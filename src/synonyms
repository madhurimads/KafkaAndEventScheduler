If you're using Oracle with Hibernate (including Hibernate 6.6.5) and Oracle synonyms aren't being picked up, it's a common and known issue. Hibernate (and many other ORMs) struggle with resolving Oracle synonyms because they‚Äôre not part of the default metadata unless specific configurations are made.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why this happens and how to work around it effectively:

üö´ Why Hibernate Doesn't Pick Up Synonyms
Hibernate relies on JDBC metadata or explicit schema configuration to resolve table names. Oracle synonyms are not visible through standard JDBC metadata unless:

You don‚Äôt specify a schema (i.e., let the DB resolve it),

Or you explicitly alter the session schema.

‚úÖ Solutions That Work
1. Do not use schema in @Table
If you use this:

java
Copy
Edit
@Table(name = "MY_TABLE", schema = "MY_SCHEMA") // ‚ùå Avoid this
Hibernate will bypass Oracle's synonym resolution.

Instead, use:

java
Copy
Edit
@Table(name = "MY_TABLE") // ‚úÖ Let Oracle resolve via synonym
2. Use CURRENT_SCHEMA to control synonym resolution
In your JDBC config, set the session‚Äôs schema to the one owning the actual tables:

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.datasource.hikari.connection-init-sql=ALTER SESSION SET CURRENT_SCHEMA=ACTUAL_SCHEMA
This allows Hibernate to see the synonym as if it's the real table.

3. Make sure the user has access to synonyms
Grant access to the app user:

sql
Copy
Edit
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ACTUAL_SCHEMA.MY_TABLE TO APP_USER;
CREATE SYNONYM APP_USER.MY_TABLE FOR ACTUAL_SCHEMA.MY_TABLE;
4. Disable Hibernate schema validation
Since synonyms are not introspectable:

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none
Or disable just validation logic manually if you use Spring Boot.

5. (Optional) Use native queries if entity mapping is too complex
Synonyms always work fine with native SQL queries:

java
Copy
Edit
@Query(value = "SELECT * FROM MY_TABLE WHERE STATUS = :status", nativeQuery = true)
List<MyEntity> findByStatus(@Param("status") String status);
üöß Hibernate 6+ Notes
In Hibernate 6, the introspection is stricter. So even with correct synonyms, it might still fail ddl-auto=validate.

There‚Äôs no out-of-the-box fix unless Oracle synonyms are made introspectable via:

Custom PhysicalNamingStrategy

Using DatabaseMetaData overrides (rare and complex)

‚úÖ Recommended Setup Summary
Step	Value/Setting
Entity annotation	@Table(name = "MY_TABLE") ‚Äî no schema
Synonym creation	CREATE SYNONYM MY_TABLE FOR actual_schema.MY_TABLE;
JDBC init SQL	ALTER SESSION SET CURRENT_SCHEMA=actual_schema
ddl-auto config	none (or update for dev, but not with synonyms)
Schema access permissions	Grant all necessary rights to the app user
